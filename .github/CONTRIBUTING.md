# Contributing

We love contributions! This document helps you figure out how to do that. Before we start, we want to address one question:

> Is this an open source project or a project that is open source?

We're actively using this project inside Cond√© Nast and have requirements that are internal to our company. We think this is useful to other folks and want to make it available to everyone. We hope you find it useful and find ways to make it even more useful. If you do, please follow the guidelines in this document and open a pull request with your changes. That said, we might not accept _every_ pull request if it moves the package in a direction that doesn't mesh with our plans.

The rest of this document outlines the guidelines for getting contributions accepted faster. Here are the others:

## Adding new features
Got an idea for a new feature? Great!! Let's talk. The easiest way to get off the ground with a new feature is to open a new issue describing what you want to do or open a work-in-progress pull request. This is the best way to get feedback to make sure you're headed in the right direction before investing a ton of time getting something just right.

## Remember the PR title becomes the Git commit subject line

Craft your PR title to say **why** you're doing the change, not what it's
doing. The what is already obvious from the diff. The why may already be
explained in the description, but not in a concise way like the title.

## Any questions? Made a mistake?

Then we need to update this document! Ask away.
