## Why are we doing this?

Does everyone understand the problem this pull request is solving? This may just be a
restatement of the ticket. Think of your audience; could someone not familiar
with the language understand? A non-technical person? Remember that this will
be preserved forever in the git history.

Can anyone else do what you did by reading the README? Did you put information
elsewhere? (Wiki/comments/"npm script")?

## Did the test coverage decrease?

coverage slip, you have to justify it.
